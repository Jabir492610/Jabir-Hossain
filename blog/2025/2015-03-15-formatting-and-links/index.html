But the high density of copper, a primary alloying element, poses a barrier to achieving a lightweight alloy, which is critical for various high-performance applications. This research focuses on understanding the effect of magnesium (Mg) in the Aluminum 7075 alloy and explores the potential of replacing copper (Cu) with Magnesium to maintain similar mechanical properties while reducing the overall weight of the alloy. The study investigates the response of the alloy’s strength to the incremental addition of magnesium, up to 5%. Various experimental procedures, including casting, homogenization, tensile testing, and hardness measurement, were conducted to analyze the mechanical properties and microstructural changes. The results indicate that while copper significantly enhances the strength and hardness through the formation of Al2CuMg precipitates, magnesium also contributes to these properties by forming MgZn2 precipitates. The findings suggest that a careful optimization of the alloy composition and heat treatment processes can enable a partial substitution of Copper with Magnesium. This substitution has the potential to reduce the alloy’s density while maintaining its mechanical integrity, thereby offering a more lightweight solution for advanced engineering applications.</p> </body></html>
